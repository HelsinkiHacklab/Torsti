* Downloading the latest pypy *
Check the suitable latest nightly build from http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/

cd /opt #Or wherever...
sudo wget http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/pypy-c-jit-78985-linux.tar.bz2
or
sudo wget http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/pypy-c-jit-78985-linux64.tar.bz2
sudo tar -xf pypy*
sudo chmod -R o+rx pypy*

Now you can call pypy with
/opt/pypy*/bin/pypy

* Installing *
For installing pypy seamlessly alongside other python versions, you can use virtualenv:
cd #Back to home
sudo easy_install pip #pip is better, but you can use easy_install for everything
sudo pip install virtualenv #Make sure you have the latest version of this
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper #If not, "sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv" will do
mkdir .virtualenvs
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh #Put this in .bashrc for future logins
mkvirtualenv -p /opt/pypy-c-jit-*/bin/pypy pypy

Now you can call "workon pypy" and every call to python will call pypy. Calling "deactivate"
will get you out of the virtualenv after which calling python will call the regular system wide
installation of python. Now you can easily switch between regular python and pypy.

Since pypy doesn't have the _tkinter c module, skeinforge will fail while importing it,
even though it isn't needed (a bug). You can comment out 
"from fabmetheus_utilities.hidden_scrollbar import HiddenScrollbar" in the file
skeinforge_application/skeinforge_utilities/skeinforge_profile.py, or add a try except clause
like this:
"""
try:
    from fabmetheus_utilities.hidden_scrollbar import HiddenScrollbar
except ImportError:
    pass
"""

Also, you have to issue "python skeinforge.py" to actually use the chosen binary in the virtualenv,
that is, pypy in our case (skeinforge.py has #!/usr/bin/python).
